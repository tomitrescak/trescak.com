  Snapshot management at its easiest.
---

Luis is particularly useful when visualising snapshots and snapshot differences. When Luis detects the snapshot difference, it can provide a visual comparison as well s code comparison.

In the test list on the left you can see the preview of the erroneous snapshot. Further, you can visualise fully rendered HTML clicking the "html" icon (considering you are storing snapshots in HTML or JSON format) or a diff view when clicking on the "code" icon. You can also view all snapshots from the given test or test suite clicking on the "image" icon.

## Visual Regression

We are currently working on a visual regression technique for comparing image snapshots. Please stay tuned.
