You can configure Luis to work as a component catalogue and a test viewer, rnning as a standalone application or part of your app. We recommend you to start with exploring Luis by going over the following list top to bottom:

1. The simplest way is to use Luis is to [run a component catalogue, working as standalone application](./catalogue.md).
2. Then, you can [configure your test framework to visualise test results in Luis](./test.md).
3. If you are using Jest, you can [visualise the snapshot differences in Luis](./snapshots.md)
4. You can have [Luis run as part of your app](./route.md), not needing a standalone instance.
